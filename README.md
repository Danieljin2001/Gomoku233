In Ned Liu-branch you will find 4 picutures and 7 files.

The testing file will run all the file that is used in demo2. 
Please make sure you have have the picture in the same folder as other files. Not all files are used in this demo. Levelwindow.java, MenuCOntroller.java and MakeButtons.java are not used in this demo, so it is ok if you do not have them when you run testing2.java. All other file must be included in the same folder in order for the program to run. (AI is not programmed into the these classes)

Make sure you have all needed file and all four pictures in the same folder before running the program
