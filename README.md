The testing file will run all the file that is used in demo2. 
Please make sure you have have the picture in the same folder as other files. Not all files are used in this demo. Levelwindow, MenuCOntroller and MakeButtons are not used in this demo, so it is ok if you do not have them when you run testing. All other file must be
