# Interactive Demo
The game we made is called gomoku. Its rule is similar to tic-tac-toe, but you win by having 5 or more of the same kind next to each other verically, horitonally or diagonally. You can play against the AI we build or you can play against another player

# How to compile and run (For Eclipse only)
Here are all the files that are needed for running the game: "OnePlayer.java, TwoPlayer.java, GameLogic.java, AIhard.java, MakeButtons.java and MenuWindow.java". Move all these files under a package named AllClass. All these files are located in master branch under : Gomoku233/Interactive Demo/src/AllClass. Then you need the four .png pictures under master branch under the path: Gomoku233/Interactive Demo/src. Before running the program, these pictures must be placed under the src folder of the project folder that all six other class are in, and build path for junit and jfxrt.jar. You need to run the MenuWindow.java in order to get the full version of the game.
