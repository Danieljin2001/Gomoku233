# Interactive Demo
  The game we made is called gomoku. Its rule is similar to tic-tac-toe, but you win by having 5 or more of the same kind next to each other 
verically, horitonally or diagonally. You can play against the AI we build or you can play against another player

## How to compile and run (For Eclipse only)
  Here are all the files that are needed for running the game: "OnePlayer.java, TwoPlayer.java, GameLogic.java, AIhard.java, MakeButtons.java and MenuWindow,java". Move all these files under a package named AllClass. All these files are located in Ned's Branch under : Gomoku233/Demo3 No Github/src/AllClass. Then you need the four pictures under Ned's branch under under the path: Gomoku233/Demo3 No Github/src. Before running the program, these pictures must be placed under the src folder of the project folder that all six other class are in. You need to run the MenuWindow.java in order to get the full version of the game.
