  This file will tell you how to get demo3 running. In the repository named Danieljin2001, go to the master branch, then 
click the folder DemoThree. Inside you will see some folders, then click the src folder. Inside the src folder you will see some 
picture, and you do need these pictures for the demo to run. Inside the folder click AllClass, and you will have access to all the files that is needed 
for demo3. The files that are needed for demo3 are MakeButtons.java, AI.java, MenuWindow.java, OnePlayer.java, and TwoPlayer.java.
The rest is not necessary for demo3. Player.java is used for the next demo. WinConditionFile contains all the checkwin functions 
from OnePlayer.java and TwoPlayer.java. TestWinFile.java is a JUnit test file that test the functions in WinConditionFile.

  When you run the code make sure you have all the image from src folder and put the in the same directory as the files. Also make sure all
the files are in the same directory when running. Run the MenuButton.java to run the full program.
